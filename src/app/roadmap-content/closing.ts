        <p>SNOMED CT will be implemented at different levels of the health system, including its integration with clinical records, 
        national registries, analytics and reporting. It will be introduced as a requirement in data exchange models and 
        implementation guides. This should be a coordinated effort that includes the clinicians, software developers, public health 
        officials and technical interoperability architects, among others.</p>
