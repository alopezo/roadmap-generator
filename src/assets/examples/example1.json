This is partly due to good access to health services of high quality. Financing is based mostly on proportional social security contributions and progressive direct taxation.

While no drastic reforms were undertaken during this period, policy-makers have pursued the goals of improving access to good quality of care while making the system sustainable. Reforms to increase the accessibility of the health system include measures to reduce the out-of-pocket payments of more vulnerable populations (low-income families and individuals as well as the chronically ill). Quality of care-related reforms have included incentives to better integrate different levels of care and the establishment of information systems, among others. Additionally, several measures on pharmaceutical products have aimed to reduce costs for both the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI) and patients, while maintaining the quality of care.</p>"},"selectedGoals":[{"opSelector":"Data exchange","text":"<p>SNOMED CT will be defined as the common reference terminology for sharing data between facilities and/or healthcare providers.
